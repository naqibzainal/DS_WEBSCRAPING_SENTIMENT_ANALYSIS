    "- This limits memory usage and speeds up training.\n",
    "- A higher number (e.g., 10,000) captures more vocabulary but increases computation time.\n",
    "- A lower number (e.g., 1,000) makes training faster but loses important words.\n",
    "- 📌 Can you change it?\n",
    "- Yes! If your dataset is large, try 10,000 or 20,000. If it's small, reduce it to 1,000 or 2,000.\n",

    "## 2️⃣ max_iter=1000 in LogisticRegression\n",
    "- 📌 What it does:\n",
    "- Logistic Regression uses an optimization algorithm (Gradient Descent) to learn sentiment patterns.max_iter=1000 means the algorithm will run up to 1,000 iterations to find the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📌 Why 1,000?\n",
    "- If set too low (e.g., 100 or 200), training might stop before reaching the best solution.\n",
    "- If set too high (e.g., 5000), it may waste time if the model already converged.\n",
    "- 1,000 is a good balance for most text classification tasks.\n",
    "- 📌 Can you change it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you see \"ConvergenceWarning: Solver did not converge\", try increasing it (e.g., 2000 or 5000).\n",
    "- If training is slow, reduce it to 500 (but check accuracy).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 TL;DR\n",
    "- ✔ max_features=5000 → Uses top 5,000 words (adjust based on dataset size).\n",
    "- ✔ max_iter=1000 → Trains model for up to 1,000 steps (increase if needed)."

    "\n",
    "The model said 10 tweets were Positive, but only 5 were actually Positive → That’s 50% precision (5/10 correct).\n",

    "## 🔹 What Can You Do?\n",
    "- ✅ Get More Tweets\n",
    "Try scraping a larger dataset (e.g., past 6–12 months).\n",

    "- ✅ Use Pretrained Sentiment Models\n",
    "Instead of training from scratch, try models like BERT or RoBERTa, which are already trained on massive datasets.\n",
    "This way, your model benefits from general sentiment knowledge even with fewer tweets.\n",

    "Use synonym replacement or paraphrasing techniques to create more training samples from existing ones.\n",
